👋 Hey there! I'm Padmaksh Paul, a web developer with a passion for crafting elegant solutions to complex problems. Currently juggling my studies for JEE alongside honing my coding skills.

💻 My journey in web development has been an exciting one, marked by building impactful websites that strive for both functionality and aesthetics.

🚀 Some of my recent projects include A kind of blog and a blog website that was my first website, where I've leveraged technologies like 
making games using pygame and unity.

🎓 When I'm not coding or hitting the books for JEE, you can find me exploring new frameworks, brainstorming project ideas, or indulging in a good cup of coffee while diving into the latest tech blogs.

🌟 Excited about the endless possibilities of the web and always eager to collaborate on innovative projects. Let's connect and create something awesome together!

🪩My first website is still present as it was free and my newest website which was paid (for a year now the time is up😶‍🌫️)so here is the link of my oldest website
